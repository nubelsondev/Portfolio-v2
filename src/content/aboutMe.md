I'm **Nubelson** , a _22-year old_ **Full-Stack Developer** , born in _Angola_ and currently living in **Portugal** who loves to _design and build_ things for **Web** and **Mobile** devices. I build websites and applications with _exceptional performance_ and interface with _efficient and modern backends_.

I have been **programming with JavaScript since 2016** and since then I have learned and been involved with the **best technologies** that surround it, thus creating memorable and _interesting products_ that in addition to providing users with a pleasant Interface and Experience, were also written with **scalable code**, thus allowing developers to be able to understand and maintain easily.

I am **motivated** by the challenges I encounter daily and motivated even more by the satisfaction of knowing that, with _focus_, _determination_ and _coffee_, I can **always overcome** them.
